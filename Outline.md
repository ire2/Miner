# Updated Outline for Minesweeper in OCaml

## 1. **Current Progress Overview**

### Completed So Far

- **Basic Board Rendering**:
  - Successfully renders a 10x10 grid using OCaml's JS bindings on an HTML canvas.
  - Can display individual cells, including revealing or flagging based on interactions.
- **Basic Game State**:
  - Board and cell structures are defined and handle mine placement, cell states (revealed, flagged), and neighbor counts.
  - Cells change color when revealed, indicating mines or clear spaces.
- **User Interaction**:
  - Cells can be revealed by clicking.
  - A flagging mechanism was started but has been replaced by other basic controls to simplify initial functionality.
- **Basic UI Components**:
  - Canvas displays the game grid.
  - Additional information like remaining mines and unrevealed cells was introduced but requires further refinement.
  - Screen can be refreshed to generate new game.

## 2. **Current OCaml Module Breakdown**

### Existing Modules

1. **`Board` Module**:
   - Handles board setup, mine placement, and calculating neighboring mines.
   - Manages the main data structure of the game.
   - **Current Status**: Complete for basic functionality, but needs to handle game-over state fully (e.g., revealing all mines).

2. **`Load` Module**:
   - Handles drawing and rendering on the canvas.
   - Updates cells based on interactions.
   - **Current Status**: Works for initial rendering and updating cells; requires expanding to display information like mine counts and remaining cells.

3. **`Main` Module**:
   - Integrates game state and rendering, handling user inputs.
   - Sets up event listeners and manages the game loop.
   - **Current Status**: Initial setup is complete, but needs refinement for handling edge cases and better responsiveness.

## 3. **Goals & Upcoming Tasks**

### Key Goals

1. **Enhance the User Interface**:
   - Add visual indicators for mines, revealed cells, remaining mines, and unrevealed cells.
   - Implement a timer and a restart button.
2. **Improve Game Logic**:
   - Add game-over behavior to reveal all mines.
   - Implement win/loss conditions and restart functionality.
3. **Add Functionality to UI Elements**:
   - Ensure dynamic updates to the mine count and unrevealed cells count.
   - Add more responsive cell selection and flag toggling.
4. **Increase Code Modularity & Documentation**:
   - Refactor existing code for clarity and modularity, ensuring each module handles a distinct part of the logic.

## 4. **Revised OCaml Module Breakdown & Next Steps**

### Enhanced Modularization

1. **`Cell` Module** (New)
   - Move individual cell logic (like toggling states, checking neighbors) into a separate module.
   - Include getter/setter functions for better encapsulation.
   - **Estimated Lines**: 100-150.

2. **`Board` Module** (Expanded)
   - Add logic to check for win/loss conditions.
   - Implement game-over behavior: revealing all mines on losing.
   - Include logic to restart the game.
   - **Next Steps**:
     - Refactor to include winning/losing checks.
     - Add a function to reset the board.
   - **Estimated Lines**: 200-250.

3. **`Load` Module** (Expanded)
   - Enhance rendering to show mine counts and remaining cells.
   - Implement additional visual elements, like highlighting revealed cells differently.
   - Add functions to display a game-over message.
   - **Next Steps**:
     - Update rendering to show flagged cells and mine counts.
     - Add logic to display all mines when game ends.
   - **Estimated Lines**: 200-250.

4. **`GameState` Module** (New)
   - Manage overall game state (win, loss, playing).
   - Track revealed cells, flagged cells, and mines left.
   - Handle transitions and game state updates.
   - **Next Steps**:
     - Add a new state management structure for clarity.
     - Implement win/loss tracking and reset functionality.
   - **Estimated Lines**: 150-200.

5. **`UserInput` Module** (New)
   - Separate user input logic for handling clicks and other interactions.
   - Handle reveal/flag toggle and other button interactions.
   - **Next Steps**:
     - Add support for right-clicks for flagging.
     - Integrate buttons for reset and display options.
   - **Estimated Lines**: 100-150.

6. **`Main` Module** (Refined)
   - Integrate all modules, focusing on game loop and event handling.
   - Manage user interactions like clicks and button presses.
   - Ensure smooth transitions between different game states (playing, win, loss).
   - **Next Steps**:
     - Integrate remaining modules to handle game flow.
     - Ensure event handling reflects new features.
   - **Estimated Lines**: 150-200.

## 5. **Upcoming Development Phases**

### Phase 1: **Finish Game Logic & Rendering Enhancements** (300-400 Lines)

- Add cell revealing logic for neighboring mine counts.
- Implement full game-over behavior and resetting.

### Phase 2: **User Interface Completion** (200-300 Lines)

- Add a timer and additional controls (restart, mine count, etc.).
- Ensure smooth updates to UI elements.

### Phase 3: **Polishing & Optimization** (200-300 Lines)

- Refactor modules for clarity and modularity.
- Improve responsiveness and UX.
- Add documentation and basic tests.

### Phase 4: **Final Touches & Preparation for Multiplayer** (100-200 Lines)

- Review all code for edge cases and finalize logic.
- Prepare for multiplayer communication (e.g., defining shared game states).

## 6. **Next Immediate Steps**

1. **Add Mines & Revealed Count to UI**:
   - Use a textbox to display the counts and update it dynamically.
2. **Implement Game-Over Behavior**:
   - Reveal all mines when losing.
   - Add a reset button for easy testing.
3. **Refactor Input Handling**:
   - Move input logic to a separate module for better organization.
4. **Test & Debug**:
   - Ensure smooth cell revealing and mine count updates.
   - Validate edge cases like clicking on a mine or flagging behavior.
